SPH SIM INFORMATION:

When increasing time step size, make sure to also lower the look ahead factor (for better simulation stability)

-- Strain test (w unoptimised GPU memory usage and performance) --
 - Maximum allowed particle count without dispatch grouping: 1000000<
 - Required dedicated GPU memory: ~1.2 GB
 - Framerate (with inter-particle springs): 55FPS (-> 165 simulation steps)
 - Simulation steps per frame: 3 steps

Dispatch size issue could be avoided by splitting the processing the buffer(s) into groups
